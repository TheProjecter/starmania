In this game there are many kinds of stars, each one has one color, for example red, blue and gold.

Each star of each color gives an specific score, red = 10 pts, blue = 20 pts, gold = 50 pts, for example.

On each level there are goals that the player needs to reach to win the game. For example, in the first level, the player needs no collect at least 10 red stars, 5 blue stars and 1 gold star. If the player accomplish the goals, some kind of "gate" will appear in some place in the level, so the player need to get to this "gate" to pass the level.

But the real challenge is that the player will have some kind of obstacles and enemies in his way. So, to collect the stars, reach the gate and go on, will not be an easy mission.
